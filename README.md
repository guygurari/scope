# The Hessian and the gradient in deep networks

Perform measurements involving the gradient, the Hessian, and relations between
them. Compute full and partial Hessian spectrum. Support fully-connected /
convnet with MNIST / CIFAR10 and various other options (dropout, batch-norm,
etc.).

For a minimal install: `python3 setup.py develop` then 
`python3 scope/train.py --help`.
